**CHAPTER 5: SYSTEM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION**

## **5.1 Functional Design**

### **5.1.1 Blockchain Implementation**

- The system must support block creation, storage, and retrieval.
- Each block must include:
  - Data payload that stores transactions or arbitrary information.
  - Previous block hash to ensure immutability and maintain chain integrity.
  - Current block hash derived from the data, previous hash, and timestamp.
  - Timestamp to record the exact time of block creation.
  - Nonce value to be used for proof-of-mining if necessary.
  - Support for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus to enable efficient validation based on stakeholder holdings.
  - Implementation of a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to ensure unbiased leader selection in block validation.
  - Blocks must be stored persistently in a file to maintain a historical record.
  - Blocks should be retrievable from the stored file and validated upon loading to prevent tampering.

### **5.1.2 Peer-to-Peer Communication**

- The system must allow multiple peers to connect and exchange data seamlessly.
- Nodes should be able to:
  - Accept and manage incoming peer connections dynamically.
  - Send and receive transactions in real time with minimal latency.
  - Maintain an updated list of connected peers to facilitate network discovery.
  - Participate in a PoS-based consensus to validate transactions and maintain fairness.
- Transactions must be serialized and transmitted using Boost.JSON to maintain structured data exchange.
- Unix domain sockets should be used for CLI interactions to enable local command execution and debugging.
- Peers must have mechanisms for handling dropped connections and retrying failed transactions.

## **5.2 Security & Cryptography**

- Hashing of block data using SHA-256 via OpenSSL EVP API to ensure cryptographic integrity.
- Secure transaction transmission using robust encryption methods to prevent unauthorized access.
- Implementation of a logging system to track peer activities, connection attempts, and transaction history.
- Protection against replay attacks and data modification through hash-based verification mechanisms.
- Periodic verification of blockchain integrity to detect potential inconsistencies or corruption.
- Integration of Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) to enhance security in leader selection and random number generation.

## **5.3 Proof-of-Stake Finality and Conflict Resolution**

### **5.3.1 Stake-Based Finality and Conflicts**

## **5.4 Command Line Interface (CLI)**

- The CLI must support:
  - Listing connected peers with details such as IP address and port.
  - Manually adding peers by specifying their address and connection details.
  - Sending transactions to all connected peers with minimal processing delay.
  - Retrieving and displaying blockchain data for debugging and analysis.
  - Logging errors and transaction details to improve traceability and debugging efforts.
